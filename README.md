    _ CHAP. V. The avarice and most cruell pride of ſome Praefects or Rulers of Thracia. Alſo the wicked trecherie and bloudie butcherie of Lupicinus, drive the Gothes to take armes, for to warre upon the Romanes.

    _ CHAP. VI. Lupicinus in araſh braid encountring the Gothes, after the loſſe of his Tribunes and many ſouldiors, flyeth. An hystoricall narration of Marcellinus, as touching theſe forraine and new upstart nations, which in former ages grievouſly afflicted ſundrie parts of the world.

    _ CHAP. VII. Other petie Princes and nations of the Gothes, commaunded to paſſe over into Helleſpontus, and wrongfully miſuſed, ioyne with others that were alreadie armed, and afterwards west and ſpoyle Thracia.

    _ CHAP. VIII. Valens distracted with manifold cares, ſendeth an armie into Thracia. The Gothes and the Romans ſtrike a battaile. The victorie not without ſweat, bloud, and teares, falleth to the Romans.

    _ CHAP. IX. The Gothes having taken in the Hunnes and Alanes to the ſocietie of their bootie, with horrible ſlaughter and ſpoile waſt Thracia, and in vaine lay ſiege to the towne Dibaltum. As they purſue Frigeridus, a most puiſſant warriour and leader, they are terrified with a new overthrow: and Frigeridus having taken many of them, confineth them about Mutina, Rhegium, and Parma, there to till the grounds.

    _ CHAP. X. The Lentienſes, a people of Alemaine, with a mightie armie break into the Roman Seigniories. In this battaile Gratian hath the upper hand, and few remained alive, ſuch as eſcaped by flight, who being courſed in the mountaines, make humble ſupplication and obtaine peace, and are ſuffered without any harme to goe into their native countries.

    _ CHAP. XI. The commendation of Gratian. Frigeridus a most excellent Captaine, and the terrour of the Gothes, is unſeaſonably called backe by Valens, who leadeth a ſtrong armie againſt the Gothes, who neere unto the river Hebrus were grievouſly diſcomfited and defeated by Sebaſtian Colonell of the Infanterie.

    _ CHAP. XII. Valens who envied the vertues of Gratian, bringing with him many bands of old experienced and ſelect ſouldiors, without expecting any aid, but in his owne pride pricked forward by the fooliſh words of flatterers, and a certaine miſchievous destinie, hasteneth to encounter the Gothes: and when their embaſsadours treated about conditions of peace, ſent them away without effect.

    _ CHAP. XIII. Fritigernus the principall leader of the Gothes, requireth to have host ages given on both ſides, that with more ſafetie there might be a treatie of peace, but by the unreaſonable and hurtfull endevour of ſome Romanes they betake themſelves againe to armes.

    _ CHAP. XIIII. The armies of the Gothes and Romanes embattailed, and their most ſharpe conflict: At length the Romanes are put to flight. As touching the death of Valens a twofold opinion: while ſome thinke he was killed with an arrow, and never after ſeene: others, that he was conſumed with fire.

    _ CHAP. XV. The vertues and vices of Valens. The end of his life, and the place where he periſhed fore-ſignified by the Oracle.

    _ CHAP. XVI. The Gothes after this victorie beſiege Hadrianopolis, but take the repulſe, and many of them in the aſsault were ſlaine.

    _ CHAP. XVII. Having left Hadrianopolis, they gave the attempt of Perinthus and Constantinople: but by ſundrie calamities daunted, they invade the Northerne Provinces. They that ſeized upon Thracia, by the meanes of Iulius, Colonell of the Footmen, in one and the ſelfe ſame day, as if a ſignall haa beene given, were all murthered: and ſo the Provinces of the Eaſt are delivered from dangers.
